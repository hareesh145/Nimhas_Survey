    <string name="section5_intro2">Thank you for agreeing to take part in this brief interview about alcohol, tobacco products and other drugs. I am going to ask you some questions about your experience of using these substances across your lifetime and in the past three months. These substances can be smoked, swallowed, snorted, inhaled, injected or taken in the form of pills (show drug card). Some of the substances listed may be prescribed by a doctor (like amphetamines, sedatives, pain medications). For this interview, we will not record medications that are used as prescribed by your doctor. However, if you have taken such medications for reasons other than prescription, or taken them more frequently or at higher doses than prescribed, please let me know. While we are also interested in knowing about your use of various illicit drugs, please be assured that information on such use will be treated as strictly confidential.</string>
